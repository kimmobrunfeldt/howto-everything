### General

* Use the products you build for at least a week. Try all edge cases in real-world environment.

* Best products surprise with quality details. Aim for perfection but know when to stop.

* Delegate. If another product does its job very well, integrate it to your new product instead of making your own, feature-poor duplicate of the already proven quality product. Delegate small tasks to existing products and focus doing integrations well.
